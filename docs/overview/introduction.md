# Introduction

Welcome to **Definitely Not** the **best trading bot with zero blockchain experience but solid bot development skills**.
Built for **TON and Solana**, Definitely Not is a **Telegram-based DEX trading bot** focused on **wallet management, price tracking, and conditional trading**.

## Current Status

This bot was created as a **testing and placeholder system**, proving that you don't need real blockchain experience to make a DEX bot—just stubbornness and API calls. Some features are **fully operational**, while others are, well... just sitting there looking pretty until we get around to them.

### **What Works? (Yes, We Tested These)**

✔ **Wallet Management (TON & Solana)** – Generate, manage, and export wallets with ease.

✔ **TON Swaps** – Powered by **Stonfi** (working in placeholder mode, pending full testing).

✔ **TON & SOL Alerts & Price Tracking** – Fully functional, supporting price alerts for native assets, jettons, and tokens.

✔ **Live Price Updates** – Broadcasted in a dedicated **Telegram channel** and available via **inline query**.

✔ **Instant Swaps** – Instantly queue a swap in the controller (depends on swap function stability).

✔ **Conditional Trades** – Triggers swaps when predefined conditions are met.

### **What’s Not Supported Yet? (AKA, To-Do List)**

⚠ **Solana Trading & Swaps** – No swaps for SOL at the moment.

⚠ **Copy Trading & Wallet Import** – Exists in spirit, but not in code.

⚠ **Full TON Swap Testing** – The function is in place but hasn’t been battle-tested.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Wallet Support** – Start with pre-generated TON & Solana wallets.
- **Real-Time Alerts** – Get notified when price conditions are met.
- **Live Price Updates** – Available in a **dedicated Telegram channel** and via inline query.
- **High Performance** – Built using **PHP (OpenSwoole) & Bun (TypeScript)** (yes, we know it's a weird combo).
- **Scalable Infrastructure** – All the pieces are here, just waiting to be assembled.
- **Multi-Language Support** – Supports **English, Persian, Arabic, Russian, Hindi, and German**.

## Purpose of Definitely Not

**Definitely Not** was built as a **testing and development tool**, proving that the hardest part of making a DEX bot isn't trading—it's but the Telegram bot itself. While **TON swaps are supported**, we haven't fully tested them because, honestly, we spent most of our time on **alerts and price tracking**. **Solana trading? Not happening (yet).**
