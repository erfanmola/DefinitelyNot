# Introduction

Welcome to **Definitely Not** – the **best trading bot with zero blockchain experience but solid bot development skills**.
Built for **TON and Solana**, Definitely Not is a **Telegram-based DEX trading bot** focused on **wallet management and TON price tracking**.

## Current Status  
This bot was created as a **testing and placeholder system**, proving that you don't need real blockchain experience to make a DEX bot—just stubbornness and API calls. Some features are **fully operational**, while others are, well... just sitting there looking pretty until we get around to them.

### **What Works? (Yes, We Tested These)**
✔ **Wallet Management (TON & Solana)** – Generate and export wallets like a pro.

✔ **TON Swaps** – Powered by **Stonfi** (we assume it works, but don’t quote us on that).

✔ **TON Alerts & Price Tracking** – Fully functional and the one thing we actually spent time on.

### **What’s Not Supported Yet? (AKA, To-Do List)**
⚠ **Solana Trading & Price Tracking** – If you’re looking for Solana trading, **you’re in the wrong place**.

⚠ **Copy Trading & Wallet Import** – Exists in spirit, but not in code.

## Key Features  
- **Multi-Wallet Support** – Start with pre-generated TON & Solana wallets.
- **Real-Time Alerts** – Get price updates that actually work.
- **High Performance** – Built using **PHP (OpenSwoole) & Bun (TypeScript)** (yes, we know it's a weird combo).
- **Scalable Infrastructure** – All the pieces are here, just waiting to be assembled.

## Purpose of Definitely Not
**Definitely Not** was built as a **testing and development tool**, proving that the hardest part of making a DEX bot isn't trading—it's getting Telegram users to read documentation. While **TON swaps are supported**, we haven't fully tested them because, honestly, we spent most of our time on **alerts and price tracking**. **Solana price tracking and trading? Not happening (yet).**
